- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BertieInSecurity

- ðŸ“« How to reach me @bertie_in_sec on Twitter!

I am an Application Security Engineer for a MAGA Big Tech company based in the UK,
and I have over 6 years of experience working in Cybersecurity (Iâ€™m still pretty new).
Before that, I was working in one of Europeâ€™s leading startups that was acquired for a
significant amount. Iâ€™ve also spent time as a penetration tester, and I hold a PhD in
Computer Science.
